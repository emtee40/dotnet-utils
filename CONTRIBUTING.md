# Contribution Guidelines

## New entry format

* Use the following format: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION (\<flair\> [ ... ])
* The link should be the name of the package or project
* Keep descriptions concise, clear and simple
* New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome

## Pull requests workflow

* **Submit one link per pull request.** If you want to add several links, create a PR for each one, unless all of the proposed projects belong to the same category. Pull requests should have a meaningful project description, why do you want to add it to the list and any other relevant information. This will help maintainers with the review process.
* **Include a link to the added project in the PR description.** This will greatly improve email messages received by everyone watching this repository.

## Quality standard

To stay on the list, projects should follow these quality standards:

* Generally useful to the community
* Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise)
* Stable
* Documented
* Tests
